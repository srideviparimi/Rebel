# Rebeel Website Clone

This is a clone of Rebel's official website home page using only HTML5 and CSS3

This includes only the face of the home page.

I just took the UI/UX design and layout of the website and tried to recreate it with static data from the actual website.
I have used all the different icons in the navigation bar and the last footer using a font-awesome library.

Both the navigation bars are formed using the display flex property to align the contents horizontally.

   This section has 3 static images that are navigated from right to left using the @keyframes property in CSS.
   All the images are navigated in an infinite loop.

   This is the body of the page that has four main sections
   a. New and Trending
   b. Top picks

   All of these sections are done mainly using basic HTML tags and CSS properties like flex.
5. The footer of the page has three parts
   a. The magenta region for all the active rebel offers
   b. The various services are done using an unordered list of HTML
   c. The third part is simply based on the copyright conditions
