# Rebeel Website Clone

This is a clone of Rebel official website home page using only HTML5 and CSS3

This includes only the face of the home page.

I just took the UI/UX design and layout of the website and triesd to recreate it with static data got from the actual website.

This project includes

1. Navigation bar 1
   This bar consists of all the options of services that are required for the user.

2. Navigation bar 2
   This bar consist of all the categories that are available for the user.

Both the navigation bars are formed using the display flex property to align the contents horizontally.

3. Hero Image section
   This section has 3 static images that are navigated from right to left using @keyframes property in css.
   All the images are navigated in a infinite loop.

4. Body of the page
   This is the body of the page that has three main sections
   a. New and Trending
   b. Top picks
   c. Shop by category
   d. Recommended for you
   All of these sections are done mainly using basic html tags and css properties like flex.

5. Footer of the image
   This footer is mainly divided for convinience into three parts.
   a. The magenta region for all the active rebel offers
   b. The various services are done using unordered list of html
   c. the third part is simply based on the copyright conditions

I have used all the different icons in the navigation bar and the last footer using font-awesome library.
